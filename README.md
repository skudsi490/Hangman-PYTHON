# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game - a simple yet fun console-based word guessing game. Step into the world of letters where you save a man from being hanged by correctly guessing the word one letter at a time.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: Each game picks a random word from a predefined list, ensuring a unique challenge every time.
- **Lives System**: Limited guesses make the game challenging. Each incorrect guess brings the hangman closer to his grim fate.
- **Visual Representation**: Visual stages of the hangman provide a clear indication of how many guesses remain.
- **Repeated Guess Protection**: The game alerts you if you repeat a guess, helping to avoid wasting attempts.
